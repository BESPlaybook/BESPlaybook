> # 1.3 Benfits of Automated Testing

An investment in automation can reap many rewards to the test team and overall project. There are primary and secondary benefits to using automated tools.

**Primary Benefits**

The primary benefits to using automation for testing can be summarized as follows:

-	Faster test execution
-	More reliable/repeatable test execution
-	Increased quality from greater test coverage due to additional tests
-	Facilitates testing of more complex scenarios
-	Less error-prone than manual testing
-	More consistent than manual testing
-	Provides for unattended 24/7 test execution
-	Ability to create additional test conditions from single script
-	Reusability of tests within and across test events
-	Ability to test more in the same or shorter time schedule
-	Testing across a variety of software/hardware platforms
-	Allows for the possibility of testing that which could not be tested manually
-	Allows for increased frequency of testing
-	Allows more effective use of testing resources (i.e. more test design, less manual execution)

**Secondary Benefits**

Secondary benefits for using automated test tools consist of support activities for testing, rather than the testing itself. These include:

-	User account creation in advance of testing
-	Database seeding with required test data
-	Creation/management of test datasets
-	Test environment configuration setup
-	Pre-test initialization activities
-	Post-test clean-up activities
-	Automated data analysis of concluded test events

**Project and Program Benefits**

The use of automation brings benefits beyond testing to the project and program. These include:

-	Improved software quality
-	Earlier defect detection
-	Fewer defects sent to next testing phase
-	Greater efficiency in accomplishing testing
-	Greater relevance of timely test results
-	Reduced risk of deployment
-	Improved test reporting 
-	Facilitated identification of defect root causes 
-	Reduced test execution cost
-	Shortened test execution period
-	Improved consistency of test executions
-	Better adapted to iterative development where more frequent testing is required
-	Improved feedback related to application quality
-	Improved system reliability through repeatability and consistency of tests
